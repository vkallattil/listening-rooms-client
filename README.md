# listening-rooms-client

Synchronized listening rooms for SoundCloud streams, with custom audio player and chat (React client for https://github.com/vkallattil/listening-rooms-api). 

* Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/gOFBRkEzBocs16J2umB4J6/LISTENING-ROOMS?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=un8D45AY54coxUXX-1
* Built on SoundCloud's Widget API: https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/html5-widget

* Notes
    * SoundCloud also has a Developer API, which I tried to use, but they currently aren't accepting any more requests, so I'm limited to their public Widget API. There's one prominent bug, and some other various cross-browser difficulties
